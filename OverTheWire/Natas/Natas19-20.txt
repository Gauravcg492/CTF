Same as the previous problem but the numbers are hex encoded along with an additional '-'.
Any username given is put in hext after '-'. So from the php code it requires the username to be admin.
So the script is modified and '-admin' is added to the cookie and hex encoded before sending.
It is given in script19.py.
